This is the source code for my _homepage_.

Yup, I know it could have been done as a simple two-pages static website.
But I don't love easy stuff, so I played around with some cool technologies like

   * [Google Appengine](http://cloud.google.com/appengine "Appengine")
   * [Facebook Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/ "Tornado") 
   * [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/ "HTML5")
   * [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/ "CloudFlare")

Just for fun.
