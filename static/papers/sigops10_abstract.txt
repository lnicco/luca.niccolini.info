Reducing energy consumption in datacenters is key to building low cost
datacenters. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of hybrid
datacenter designs that mix low power platforms with high performance ones. We
show how these designs can handle diverse workloads with different service
level agreements in an energy efficient fashion. We evaluate the feasibility of
our approach through experiments and then discuss the design challenges and
options of hybrid datacenters.
