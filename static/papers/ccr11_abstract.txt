We propose a hybrid multiprocessor architecture for energy-proportional web
servers and datacenters, to achieve significant energy savings at the price of
small increase in service delay.  The server consists of a subsystem with
low-power cores, always on and serving user requests when load is low, and a
high-performance subsystem, by default in sleep mode, woken up only when the
load is high. Through experiments on a hardware prototype and an accurate
timing and power model of the server we assess performance and achievable
energy benefits and explore design guidelines for future energy-proportional
systems.
