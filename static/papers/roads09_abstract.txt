Live information on network behavior plays a fundamental role in network
testbeds both for management purposes and for distributed applications
debugging. During the demonstration we introduce the new PlanetLab Europe (PLE)
packet-tracking infrastructure and show how users can easily and safely
inspect their network experiments using a simple web interface. PlanetLab
Europe sites can be augmented with network monitoring hardware used both for
passive and active monitoring. Here we focus on passive monitoring by means of
the CoMo opensource platform.
